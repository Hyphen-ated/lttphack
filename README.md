This is a fork of v9 of the LTTP practice hack to make coordinates display
in decimal again instead of hex, but still have all the other nice new
features of v9. This is needed because many LTTP glitch tutorials made with
older versions of the practice hack tell you to stand on specific decimal
coordinates.

To use: download from https://github.com/Hyphen-ated/lttphack/releases
then apply the appropriate IPS patch to a copy of LTTP 1.0j
(google 3322effc)

Use the IPS patch with "SD2SNES" in the name if you're playing on an SD2SNES
flash cart. Otherwise use the other one.

If you haven't worked with an IPS patch before, one popular tool is called
"Lunar IPS"
